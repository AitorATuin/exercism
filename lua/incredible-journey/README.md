== Description ==

A group of animals are trying to find their way home. There were 6 of them:

 * 1 dog
 * 2 puppies
 * 1 cat
 * 2 kittens

They met up with a:
 
 * 1 human an animal trainer
 * his friend a lion.
 
They were all heading the same way so they joined up as a team. The only
problem is that the different groups don't really get along.

They came to a point in the path where they had to cross a river and the only
way was to take a boat that can only handle 1 or 2 passengers at a time.

Your task is to make sure that all members of the group can cross the river
safely.
